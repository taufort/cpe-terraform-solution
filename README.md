### Module 4 - AWS Cloud Security - Solution

You'll find three solutions for this module:
* The first solution is to use an inlined JSON AWS IAM policy in the `aws_sns_topic` resource directly. This solution
works fine but is not very easy to maintain because you're manipulating JSON directly. This solution can be found
in `04_cloud_security/solution_1` directory.
* The second solution is to use the `aws_iam_policy_document` datasource instead on an inline IAM policy. This solution 
is more user-friendly because you do not have to manipulate JSON directly (the JSON is generated thanks
to the `aws_iam_policy_document` datasource). This solution can be found in `04_cloud_security/solution_2` directory.
* The third solution is to use the `aws_sns_topic_policy` resource and the `aws_iam_policy_document` datasource. 
This solution can be found in `04_cloud_security/solution_3` directory.
